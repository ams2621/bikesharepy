# Project Name : Explore US Bikeshare Data

# Date : 18/05/2020

# Overview and Statistics : Using Python, explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. Perform data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics. And also make use of a package that is not part of the standard Python library to help you visualize the data.
